# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2021)

The Library and Documentation I used for this project was Biopython. I used their resources on Genome Diagrams and created my own Circular Genome Diagram in Python. It accepts the genbank files given and assigns the color to the different genes in the diagram. It also labels the features names in order to show which gene is where on the strand. It is important to note that the complement strand is put on the inside of the diagram to indicate where the gene is located. 
This diagram could be improved by possibly using multiple tracks in order to stop feature collision where you can't see specific parts of a gene.
